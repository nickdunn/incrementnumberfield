# Increment Number Field

Increments a number each time an entry is shown in a page. Useful for simple hit counters and generating sorted "most popular" lists for your content.

## Installation

1. Upload the `incrementnumberfield` folder in this archive to your Symphony `extensions` folder.
2. Enable it by selecting "Increment Number" on the Extensions page.
3. You can now add the "Increment Number" field to your sections.

## Usage

Add the field to a section. When selecting these entries via a data source choose between the two output modes:

* `view` returns the current value
* `increment` will increase the value by `1` when the data source executes
